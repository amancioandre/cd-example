Code delivery to a development machine is great and it should be done more often and faster: it helps teams communicate, visualize and prove their newborn apps features. There were many times I found myself having trouble to navigate over services and APIs my team was conceptualizing, besides being tiresome, pulling and starting lots of docker containers was also time consuming.
However this approach comes with the expense of setting up Continuous Integration as it was meant to be, the tight and fast conceptual exploration compensates for late test development.
